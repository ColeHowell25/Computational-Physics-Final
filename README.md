# Computational-Physics-Final

This was my final project for computational physics. The purpose of this code was to determine the orbital path of an object around the sun given initial conditions. It used a Runge-Kutta differential equation algorithm to solve the orbital differential equation. It would then produce a graph of the object's path.
